# üß™ Testing Instructions - Dude AI Browser Assistant

## üìã Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for judges and evaluators of the Dude AI Browser Assistant Chrome extension. The extension leverages Chrome's built-in AI APIs and includes fallback mechanisms for testing environments.

## üîß Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Chrome Browser**: Version 127+ (Chrome Canary recommended for Built-in AI functionality)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)


### Chrome AI API Setup (Built-ins)

For full AI functionality, enable these flags in `chrome://flags/` in Chrome Canary or Dev:

1. `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` - Enable Gemini Nano prompt API
2. `#summarization-api-for-gemini-nano` - Enable summarization API
3. `#translation-api` - Enable translation API
4. `#ai-features` - Enable general AI features

After enabling flags, restart Chrome and wait for model downloads (may take 5-10 minutes on first use).

**Alternative**: If Chrome Built-in AI is unavailable, you can use the Gemini API fallback by adding your API key in Settings.
